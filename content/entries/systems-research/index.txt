text: At that time, in 1965, as an artist, or Conceptual Designer, I was looking at models of advertising. I got very involved in advertising theory, and I thought coupling this with cybernetics was interesting. I mean, you have to think that cybernetics at that time was strongly associated with determinism. The philosophical models developed in the late ‘50s had been appropriated pretty rapidly by all sorts of organizations which had the financial support for development of further ideas. You had this crazy situation when I was at Systems Research, with people developing far reaching speculative models, but the contract they had was with the police or something like that. It was wholly unsatisfactory. But I realized that these same models could be used in quite a different way, to liberate the person. Instead of as a Pavlovian outcome, it could be quite different. In fact, you could connect with learning theory and with advertising theory, especially the idea of multi-channel feed forward heuristics in advertising, which I got involved in, time-based strategies of presenting and acquiring information. Again, these ideas from advertising had a deterministic outcome, but the same theories could be applied to quite a different outcome.

The outcome that I was interested in was the idea of self-organization. Transformation in the self, or creative potential of the self, so that anybody could create their own being in relation to other people. I was interested in society. I see that there’s a richness in relationships between people, community. That was _Control_ magazine, really. It was the idea to set up a mechanism for people to externalize models of their practice in a society, in a community. There wasn’t anything like that around at all.

I managed to get theoretical models out of these advertising agencies. I met a guy called Dean Bradley and he’d come from New York to London. He was associated with the Pushpin agency. He came to London and he wanted to set up an agency here, which he did, it turned into a very well known agency. He became a friend of mine, and he did the graphics for the first issue. Dean was really only associated with issue number one, but then we carried on the same aesthetic for a while.

text: The other thing that I got involved in was educational programs. Education was a great means of developing ideas. Working with a group of students you could develop in a free environment where you could create really radical ideas and models. I was lucky, I got a whole year with a group of students and I created this course where there was no difference between staff and students and all the work was cooperative and collaborative. There was no individual competitive work. Out of that, I remember there was no way in which we could discuss these ideas and externalize them to other artists or anybody like that. We had the feeling that we were going to places that nobody had ever been before, and yet we had no way of externalizing this to other artists and establishing those philosophical models.

That’s really how _Control_ came about. It was through that need, but it was also part of this idea of the Conceptual Designer. If you look at the first issue of _Control_ it was really an artwork, it wasn’t seen as a magazine. You’ve got a purple spot on the cover and a purple spot on the inside. The idea was that you took the purple spot inside, pinned it on the wall, put a chair underneath it and sat there with the magazine, so there was a connection between the two purple spots, the one on the inside of the magazine, which you put on the wall, and the one on the cover of the magazine. It was a kind of philosophical idea.

We had all sorts of names that we were thinking of for the magazine, but in the end, I settled on _Control_ because, for one it’s a polemical word, and it’s pivotal in denoting different models of society. For instance, the common idea of control is of a hierarchical, top-down deterministic system, like you might get in the military or something like that. Our society is more or less like that here, but there are other models of control. The control that we were interested in was the idea of self-organizing, homeostatic, one-layer systems. The idea of networks between people. In a way we were entering, shall we say, free flowing, totally flexible models of relationships really, which has got us into a lot of trouble, but anyway…
